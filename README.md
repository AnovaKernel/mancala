Mancala
=======
Excercise for Test Driven Development; implement [Mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala).

Package
------------

The package *logic* contains the implementation. *presentation* was something I added to make at easier to follow what was happening.

Unit testing
-----------

Unit testing uses the framework JUnit. It's added as a Maven dependency in the pom.xml and can also be [downloaded here](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Download-and-Install).
